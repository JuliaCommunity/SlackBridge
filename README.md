# SlackBridge

## FAQ

**Q**: Is the HelpDeskBot service opt-in only or does it save all of my data?
**A**: The HelpDeskBot only re-posts your Slack question to Discourse if you opt-in. 

**Q**: My original message was not that clear, can I edit it before porting it over to Discourse? 
**A**: Yes! If you edit your original question before reacting with :bridge:", the bot will automatically send over the edited version. 

**Q**: My original post was not clear, can I edit it on Discourse? 
**A**: Yes, those with sufficient Discourse privileges can edit the post on Discourse as well as the title. 

**Q**: Can I customize the title for my post?
**A**: Not yet, but we are working on a way to do that so the titles are more relevant to the posts. 

**Q**: If someone answers my question on Discourse after it is ported over, will I know? 
**A**: No, you need to use the link posted after you opt-in to follow the post on Discourse. 

**Q**: Is there an automated way to mark something as a solution in Slack so it gets ported over? 
**A**: Not at this time. We are actively looking for a solution to this. 

**Q**: Can I opt out of the service entirely, I don't like seeing bots. 
**A**: At this time, no. But it is something we are exploring and may add in the future. 

**Q**: Why does the bridge itself exist between Slack and Discourse? 
**A**: We have a free Slack workspace so only 10,000 messages are visible at any one time. That means that pretty much all content will disappear after a few days or weeks. This helps fix that issue! 

**Q**: What is use to build the bot/bridging service? 
**A**: We currently use Zapier.com for the bridge/bot.
